## 📈 Day 10: Importance of Growth Rate

### Definition
**Growth Rate:** The rate at which running time increases as a function of input size ($n$).

### Comparison: Worst-Case Scenario (n=100)
| Algorithm | Max Comparisons | Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Linear Search** | 100 | $O(n)$ |
| **Binary Search** | 7 | $O(\log n)$ |

> **Key Takeaway:** As the input size grows, the speed of Binary Search stays much faster than Linear Search. We measure this using **Big O notation**.
