# Introduction to Analysis of Algorithms

Analysis of algorithms is the study of an algorithm's performance based on **time** and **memory consumption**. We always prefer the algorithm that takes the **least time** and **least memory space**.

## Two Methods of Analysis:

| Feature | Priori Analysis | Posteriori Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Definition** | Estimation of time/space **before** execution. | Calculation of time/space **after** execution. |
| **Dependency** | Independent of language and hardware. | Dependent on language and hardware. |
| **Tools** | Can be done on pen and paper. | Requires a system/text editor to run. |
